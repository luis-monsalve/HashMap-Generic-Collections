# HashMap-Generic-Collections
This program reads a file and creates a HashMap in which the keys are the years and each key's associated value is the name of the team that won that year
The program should prompt the user for a year in the range of 1903 through 2021. It
should then display the name of the team that won the World Series that year and the
number of times that team has won the World Series.
